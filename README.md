## Project Workflow and Github Setup

### Commit Message Rules
Use descriptive prefixes for commit messages:
* `feat:` for new features.
* `task:` for general tasks or sub-features.
* `chore:` for routine maintenance or build changes.
* `fix:` for bug fixes.
* `bug:` (alternative to `fix`, for specific bug tracking).

### Branches
* **`main`**: The stable, deployable production branch.
* **`feature/<name>`**: For new features (e.g., `feature/color-picker`).
* **`bugfix/<description>`**: For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/gallery-load-error`).

### Merges
* All merges into `main` **require a Pull Request (PR)**.
* All PRs **require at least one review** from a teammate.

### Small Reminders
* **Always `git pull origin main`** before creating a new branch or starting work to ensure you have the latest code.
* **Never commit directly to `main`**.
* **Create a new branch for every task/feature/bugfix.**
* **Push frequently** to your feature branch (`git push origin <branch-name>`).
* **Delete feature/bugfix branches** after they are merged.
* Use **GitHub Issues** for task tracking and assign them.
* Use the **Project Board** to visualize task progress (To Do, In Progress, Done).
